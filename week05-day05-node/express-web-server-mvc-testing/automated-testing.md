# Why Automated Testing?

* New code might break existing functionality - regression
* To catch bugs before production
* Quicker (and cheaper) than manual Testing
* Can be scheduled to run without human input
* Helps you to think about your code structure - makes it better
* Gives you more confidence in your code
* Cost of finding and fixing bugs
* Fix bug; write tests for it

## Test Driven Development

* Tests drive development, write the tests before you write the code.
* User requirements --> write tests --> software
